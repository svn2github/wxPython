Notes on stuff to do on the FloatCanvas Project:
* still some bugs on OS-X when trying to add stuff to the NavCanvas toolbar

* re-factor to use Refresh() and the occasional Update(), rather than a wxClientDC -- this should
  speed things up, particularly on the Mac.

* make sure EVT_ERASE_BACKGOUND is being caught when it should -- maybe some flicker reduction will result!

* Break out FloatCanvas.py into more modules:
  - One for Events?
  - One for DrawObjects
  - ???

* Add a demo of the Grid to the main demo

* Add a group demo to the main demo.

* Make a "Relative Group" object -- with the coordinates relative to the group,
  rather than world coords.

* Keep track of the part of the BB that gets uncovered in a MoveImage
  call, so it only draws what you need to. Also have MoveImage blit the
  current buffer in the right place first, so that only the part that needs
  to be is blank

* look at what MPL has for Bounding Box code, maybe I can borrow that 
  to make the BB object faster (But first profile to see if there is any point!)

* Can I use PyEventBinder and EvtHandler with the DrawObjects?

* merge Line, ArrowLine and Arrow code: DRY!

* test YDown Projection code. It caused problems with:
   - ScaledTextBox
   -- ???
   -- maybe just Y-up or Y-down and have projections outside the FloatCanvas?

* the "InForeground" parameter shouldn't be part of the DrawObject
__init__. It should be part of the Add* methods only. Unless I'm going
to get rid of the whole idea of DrawObjects being independent of the
Canvas they are on.

* Add FloatCanvas methods to move objects up and down in the z-order:
  MoveUp(), MoveDown(), MoveToTop(), MoveToBottom(). You can use:
  
  >>> l = range(10)
  >>> l[2:4] = l[3:1:-1]
  >>> l
  [0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  
  to shift things in the list.


* Let the user define ppi, then set properties in points (or inches, or???).

* Refactor the Projection code, to make it more flexible: ultimately
adding a wide variety of projections. But maybe not: in some ways, it
really doesn't make sense to re-project whenever the objects are
drawn. The re-factor is still a good idea, however.

* Add a PadSize to the regular text object: a spacer, so that you can
  put text a set number of pixels away from the reference point

* Add a FloatCanvas.Bind() method, rather than the EVT_** binding functions.

* Re-Structure so that the DrawObjects don't need a reference to the
Canvas. This will require a different Bind() method, among other things.

* Have a mechanism for objects to let the canvas know that they have
changed, so that the force flag to Draw() is no longer required

* When objects get removed from the Canvas, their bindings don't. Fix
this!

* Explore adding multiple layers of transparent bitmaps...or bitmaps
with a black background that get blitted wx.OR.

* Printing: Brent Turner implemented this, but I haven't tested or
integrated it yet.

* UnBindAll is not robust, and there should be an individual unbind also

***********Small stuff ***********
* Make all LineAndFill objects use SetUpDraw() method

* Re-factor the Circle object to use DC.DrawCircle. Maybe add a
DC.DrawCircleList() method to wxPython as well.

*Add some exception handling to the drawing code, so that if one object
doesn't draw, the rest will.

*Add zoom limits for Scaled text, so as to not try and draw text too
big. This is done., but it's now hard coded to a font size that happens
to work on my system.

* Clean up public vs private attribute names


***********Open issues**************

* When I started writing the code I was trying to make a way to draw that
didn't require the programmer using FloatCanvas to know anything about
wxDCs. The result is that you never directly pass in a wxPen, or a
wxColour, etc. I'm not sure if this is a good design goal anymore. I'm
not sure anyone can use it without a pretty good understanding of
wxPython anyway, so what's the point?

* I have a whole system for caching pens and brushes. I think that's now
obsolete...am I right?

* Should all DrawObjects have a unique name or id number? At the moment,
I don't see a need for them, and the user code can add one itself if it
wants. Somehow, however, it seems like it would be useful, if for no
other reason than to give a consistant interface to the naming
convention. Note that all Python objects get an ID, so we could use this.

* Similar to above...A UserData attribute: This would help prevent
the user accidentally overriding attribute names by adding arbitrary
stuff themselves. Perhaps an empty class, so that users could stuff
whatever they want into it.

* Refactor the BoundingBox check so that each object knows whether it
needs to be drawn or not, rather than doing it outside the objects. This
would let objects define their own methods for determining whether to
draw. This would let us make the Grid objects just a special kind of
DrawObject that could be anywhere in the Z-order. Would this slow down
the check too much?
